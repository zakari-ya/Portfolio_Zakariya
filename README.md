# Wolfpixel Design Portfolio – Template

A premium, editorial-grade portfolio template designed for clarity, authority, and high-end visual storytelling.

This repository is a full-scale portfolio project converted into a reusable template. Unlike generic starters, it maintains the complete design system and architectural depth of a production-grade site, while using generic placeholder content to protect personal data. It is engineered for developers and designers who value professional aesthetics and performance.

## Why This Portfolio Exists

In an era where most portfolios rely on overused templates and flashy gimmicks, the **Wolfpixel Style** focuses on what truly matters: your work and your professional narrative.

Generic templates often prioritize ease of use over design discipline. This project flips that script, offering a system that enforces a strict editorial hierarchy. It is built for those who want to present themselves as experts rather than enthusiasts — professionals who understand that whitespace, typography, and subtle motion are the true markers of a premium digital experience.

## Design Philosophy

The Wolfpixel design system is built on a "less, but better" principle:

- **Monochrome & Minimal**: A sophisticated color palette that ensures your projects remain the focal point.
- **Grid Discipline**: Every element is aligned to a strict grid, creating a sense of balance and order.
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle backdrop blurs and translucent layers add depth without cluttering the UI.
- **Intentional Motion**: Animations are descriptive, not decorative — they guide the user's attention through the narrative.

## Template Philosophy

This repository contains **placeholder data**. It is a framework for your professional identity. Users are expected to curate their own content to maintain the integrity of the design system.

**Items to replace:**

- **Identity**: Change the names, bios, and titles in the Hero and Footer components.
- **Images**: Replace placeholder project images and CV thumbnails with your own assets.
- **Projects**: Update the project array with real-world case studies and live links.
- **Stats**: Adjust the professional metrics to reflect your actual experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Motion**: Framer Motion & GSAP
